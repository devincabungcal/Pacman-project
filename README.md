# Pacmanproject
This project focused on moving an object around within the confines of a given window and switching directions when the conditions are fulfilled.
Upon loading this page, the character will begin moving back and forth across the page while opening and closing it's mouth.
Future improvements to this project include adding more paths of movement and having the character interact with other objects.
